This is a simple program designed to demonstrate the IsTextUnicode API and how it affected the loading of plain text files in Notepad for Windows XP and below.
Program requires .NET Framework 4.0 or later but it uses the same Win32 API that Notepad used back in the day, and has the same glitches even in modern Windows versions like Windows 11.

This program is public domain and intended for educational purposes.
